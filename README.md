# Old-School

This was my first C program, while studying at the [University of Marseille Luminy](http://sciences.univ-amu.fr/sites-geographiques/site-luminy) in 2011.

All code is in a really ugly single C file, using lots of globals and should not be compiled with any strict flag. :)

But I feel a little nostalgic when I read it, and makes me see the evolution of my programming style.
